Data Professionals Survey Breakdown Dashboard
​This repository contains the visual results and key metrics from a recent survey of data professionals.
​The interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive look at the industry landscape across several critical dimensions:
​Career Trajectories: Average salary distribution across primary job titles (Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, etc.).
​Technical Proficiency: Breakdown of preferred programming languages used by respondents (led by Python).
​Industry Barriers: Quantified difficulty of breaking into the field.
​Professional Sentiment: Metrics for work/life balance and happiness with salary.
​Key Findings
​Based on the survey data, several critical trends shape the current professional landscape:
​Entry Difficulty is High: The largest segment of respondents (42.7%) classify the difficulty of breaking into the industry as either "Difficult" or "Very Difficult," indicating a high barrier to entry for aspiring professionals.
​Python Dominance: Python remains the overwhelmingly preferred and dominant programming language, reinforcing its status as the core skill for technical roles.
​Worrying Work/Life Balance: Despite high salaries for top roles, the average Happiness with Work/Life Balance score is a moderate 5.74 out of 10, suggesting that high compensation often comes with professional trade-offs.
​Data Scientist Compensation: The Data Scientist role registers the highest average salary, positioning it as the top financial goal, though this must be weighed against the noted entry difficulty.
